 <h2> COMMUNITY </h2>

 <div id ="article2">
         This is the place where a life-chat system is available to ask questions and to share experience during the pilot-test classes on a daily basis for any doubt which may arise on its usage.
       <br><br>
       Moderated by the trainers in each partner country the community is specially designed space for the participants in the courses.
       <br><br>
       The “new-born old” community will therefore have a place to actively learn by doing, self-educate and share opinions about actual problems. Elders participating to the community have a go on overcoming their digital resistance and fears, increasing their awareness about active ageing and actively get accustomed to “think and act digitally”, reading e-newspapers, practicing the newly acquired e-skills
